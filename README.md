An interactive Java Swing application that helps users find the shortest and most efficient routes between metro stations using classic graph traversal algorithms. The application visually simulates pathfinding using Dijkstra, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS), making it easy to understand how each algorithm explores the metro network.
